# FishGame
Just trying to make a fish game

As of now this is an incomplete project and this repository is just a text input output demo of how the flow of the game will feel. 
The goal of this project was to apply concepts i've learned from courses I took for this project it uses object oriented programming concepts 
and some unfamiliar data structures to me like hashset and hashmap in java
